[tools]

; some of these need to be available to MAKE as well as substituted
; in commandlines, so we'll export them as shell variables

; assume python is on the path
PYTHON = python

; java and javac are on the path
JDKRUN = java
JDKC = javac

;JDKRUN = C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.6.0_23/bin/java
;JDKC = C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.6.0_23/bin/javac



;;; 2) WHAT COMMAND LINE SHOULD BE USED TO RUN THE PROGRAMS? 

[commandlines]

; commandlines are split on spaces, so "a b" and 'a b' will be split

; %X %T %B %I %A in commandlines are replaced like this:
;
; nbody.python-4.python %X = nbody.python-4.python
; nbody.python-4.python %T = nbody
; nbody.python-4.python %B = nbody.python-4
; nbody.python-4.python %I = 4
;
; %A = [testrange] value or 0 when the program takes input from stdin


python = $PYTHON %X %A

; (For multiprocessing make sure the extension is .py)
;python = $PYTHON -O %B.py %A

java = $JDKRUN $JDKFLAGS -server %T %A

;javaxint = $JDKRUN $JDKFLAGS -server -Xint %T %A



;;; 3) WHICH PROGRAMS AND LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATIONS SHOULD BE MEASURED? 

[filters]

; ONLYDIRS explicitly listed are searched for source code files

onlydirs = 
 nbody
 regexdna



; ALLOW these helper file extensions to be available unchanged 
; from the working directory - they will never be measured

allow = 



; ONLY measure files with these extensions 
; if there are none, measure files with any extension not ALLOWed or IGNOREd

only = 


; IGNORE files with these extensions, if there are no ONLY extensions

ignore =
 txt


[alias]

; x = y z - additionally measure source file x with implementations y and z




[build]

; compile source code (or rename source files) 
; using make with my.linux.Makefile

make =
 java javaxint



;;; 4) WHAT DATA VALUES SHOULD THE PROGRAMS BE MEASURED FOR?

[testrange]

; One or more input values, programs will be run at least once
; with each input value replacing %A in the command line.
;
; Or when there's [testdata] for programs the input value
; makes up part of the filename - the file contents will be
; redirected to stdin.
;
; In this example, the input file for regexdna should be named
;    regexdna-input10000.txt
; and should be located in
;    bencher/tmp/regexdna

;;; 5) WHAT TOOLS SHOULD BE USED TO CHECK PROGRAM OUTPUT IS CORRECT?

[outputcheck]

; Program output is usually checked against an "expected" output
; file. If there's no "expected" output file then the output of the
; first program measured for that test becomes the "expected" output
; - so make sure that output is correct!

; The default output check uses GNU diff.
; If GNU diff isn't found the default output check uses filecmp.cmp
;
; Other options are:
;    prevent output check, use GNU cmp, use ndiff



; prevent output being checked for the named test

notchecked =
; nbody chameneosredux


; check binary output with cmp for the named test

binarycmp =
; mandelbrot



[ndiff_outputcheck]

; check output with ndiff and these parameters for the named test

;chameneosredux = -fields 2-10
;nbody = -abserr 1.0e-8



;;; 6) WHAT COMMAND LINE OPTIONS SHOULD BE USED FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS?

; some of these need to be available to MAKE as well as substituted
; in commandlines, so we'll export them as shell variables


[nbody]

;JDKFLAGS = -Xmx8m



;;; 7) HOW MANY MEASUREMENTS SHOULD BE MADE FOR EACH PROGRAM?

[measure]

; how many repeated measurements at the same [testrange] value?
runs = 6

; repeat measurements at every [testrange] value
; or just the largest? (True or False)
repeatevery = False

; how many seconds before we timeout a program?

; took less than cutoff seconds
